# GPU-Accelerated-Implementation-of-the-Fluidity-Atmosphere-Dynamical-Core
This repository provides the GPU-accelerated implementation of the Fluidity-Atmosphere dynamical core developed in our study. It includes the core Fortran modules, CUDA kernels, GPU–CPU interface code, and build scripts necessary to reproduce the GPU results reported in the paper.
